Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

<!-- Core Summary — What You Do
Give a high-level view of your academic focus and professional identity.
Make it one compact paragraph (3–4 lines).

Currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Information Engineering at the University of Padova, I explore the intersection of bioengineering, data systems, and intelligent design. My work sits where biological insight meets computational innovation — building smarter, data-driven solutions inspired by nature itself.

---------------

What Drives You — Personal Edge
Add a touch of motivation or research philosophy.
Show what excites you, not just what you study.

I’m driven by the challenge of translating complex biological signals into actionable engineering models. Whether it’s optimizing medical sensors or decoding physiological data, I believe innovation begins where disciplines collide.

---------------------

Experience Snapshot — Not a CV
Summarize your professional or academic highlights in 2–3 clean bullet lines.

Example:

🧠 Research on machine learning for physiological data interpretation

⚙️ Background in bioengineering (M.Sc., University of Padova)

🌍 Collaborations with interdisciplinary teams in biomedical data analysis


---------------------

Beyond the Lab — Human Side

Add one or two short sentences that make you memorable.

Example structure:

Outside research, I enjoy creative coding, minimalist design, and hiking quiet trails where complex ideas often find simple answers



-------------------------
Contact or Motto (optional)

End with a small sign-off or personal motto.

Example:

“Engineering life — one system at a time.”
or
Let’s connect if you think biology and computation have more to say together.
